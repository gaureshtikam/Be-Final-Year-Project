      ingredients: [
        "2 cups coconut milk – lite or with a thin to medium consistency",
        "3 bananas – medium sized",
        "2 to 3 tablespoons raw sugar or as required, optional",
        "½ teaspoon vanilla extract or 1 to 2 pinches of vanilla powder (optional)",
        "¼ teaspoon cardamom powder or ground cinnamon powder for garnish – (optional)",
      ],
      preparation:
      '''For Banana Milkshake
Step 1
First peel and chop 3 medium sized bananas, roughly 2 cups. Add the chopped bananas in a mixer or blender jar.
Step 2
hen add 2 cups of lite coconut milk or thin coconut milk, preferably cold or chilled. I have used Homemade Coconut Milk with a very thin consistency.
Step 3
Add a ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract, or 1 to 2 pinches of vanilla powder. This is optional, but the vanilla really does help to balance the sweetness of the banana and adds great flavor.
step 4
Add 2 to 3 tablespoons, or more or less to taste, of raw sugar or jaggery. You can also use palm sugar, coconut sugar, honey or maple syrup instead of raw sugar, if you prefer. Or opt to omit the sweetener.
Step 5
Blend until smooth. If you find the banana shake to be very thick, add a few splashes of water and blend again until you get the desired consistency.
Step 6
Pour into 2 large or 3 small glasses.
Step 7
Serving Suggestions
1)If you like you can sprinkle some cinnamon or cardamom powder onto each banana milkshake. Serve right away while cold.
2)Banana discolors due to oxidation, so to get the best flavor and taste, drink the shake as soon as you make it. I would not recommend to refrigerate the banana shake even for a few hours.'''),
