      preparation: '''For Oatmeal
Step 1
Take the oats in a pan.
Step 2
Add 2 cups water and 1/2 to 1 cup milk. Consistency can be easily adjusted as per your requirements.
Step 3
1/2 cup milk gives a slightly thick consistency. For a thinner consistency, you can add more milk or water.
Step 4
Add sugar as per taste. I just added 2 tbsp sugar. Sugar is completely optional. If adding fruits later, then you can skip sugar.
Step 5
If adding honey, then add when the porridge becomes lukewarm or cools down at room temperature, as honey becomes toxic on being heated.
Step 6
Stir very well and heat the porridge mixture on a low to medium flame.
Step 7
Do stir often and allow the porridge to simmer.
Step 8
It will also thicken as it cooks. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes.
Step 9
Serve oats porridge hot or warm or at room temperature. 
Step 10
If serving oats porridge at room temperature then do note that it will thicken more as it cools. If adding chopped fruits, then add it when the porridge becomes lukewarm or cooled down completely. You can also add chopped dry fruits of your choice.'''),

If you are using aluminium pressure cooker then do all 4-whistles over medium flame.) Turn off the flame and let the pressure releases naturally. Open the lid and sprinkle cumin-coriander powder.
